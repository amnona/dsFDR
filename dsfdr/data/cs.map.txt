Bacterial communities were profiled using 454 pyrosequencing of 16S sequence tags (803,391 total reads), aligned to 16S rRNA databases, and communities compared using the UniFrac distance metric.	Disordered Microbial Communities in the Upper Respiratory Tract of Cigarette Smokers	TCAG	Genomic DNA was extracted from swabs using the QIAamp DNA Stool Minikit (Qiagen) with the following modifications. 1500ul of ASL buffer and 5mM DTT was added to the nylon tips of frozen swabs that had been cut into beadbeater tubes. Tubes were beadbeat using BioSpec Products Inc. Minibeadbeater-16 for 1 min and incubated at 95C for 10 min. The remaining steps were preformed as per manufacturer protocol. DNA was eluted with 100 uL buffer EB (Qiagen) and stored at _20C. For each sample, we amplified the 16s rRNA gene using the reverse primer 5_-GCCTCCCTCGCGCCATCAGNNNNNNNN CTGCTGCCTYCCGTA-3_ and the forward primer 5_-GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAG AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3_. The underlined sequences are the 454 Life Sciences primer B (forward) and A (reverse). The italicized sequence is the broad range bacterial primer BSR357 (reverse) and BSF8 (forward). Each reverse primer contained a unique 8-nt error-correcting Hamming barcode (designated by NNNNNNNN) used to tag each PCR product. Duplicate 25uL reactions were carried out with AccuPrime Taq DNA Polymerase High Fidelity (Invitrogen) under the following reaction conditions: 2.5 uL 10_ Buffer 2, 0.4 uL Taq, 11.1 uL PCR-grade H2O, 0.5 uL forward primer and 0.5 uL reverse primer (20 pmol/uL each) and 10 uL template DNA. PCR reactions were assembled in a PCR bay in which all surfaces and pipettes had been decontaminated with DNA AWAY (Molecular BioProducts). Reactions were run on a Applied Biosystems Veriti thermocycler with the following cycling conditions: initial denaturing at 95C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 95C for 30 seconds, annealing at 56C for 30 seconds, and extension at 72 C for 90 seconds, with a final extension of 8 min at 72C. Replicate amplicons were pooled and visualized on 0.8% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide. Amplicons were bead purified using Agencourt AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter) as per manufacturer instructions. Purified amplicons were quantified using Quant-iT PicoGreen kit (Invitrogen) and pooled in equimolar ratios. Pyrosequencing was carried out using primer A and the Titanium amplicon kit on a 454 Life Sciences Genome Sequencer FLX instrument.

Bacterial communities were profiled using 454 pyrosequencing of 16S sequence tags (803,391 total reads), aligned to 16S rRNA databases, and communities compared using the UniFrac distance metric.	Disordered Microbial Communities in the Upper Respiratory Tract of Cigarette Smokers	TCAG	Genomic DNA was extracted from swabs using the QIAamp DNA Stool Minikit (Qiagen) with the following modifications. 1500ul of ASL buffer and 5mM DTT was added to the nylon tips of frozen swabs that had been cut into beadbeater tubes. Tubes were beadbeat using BioSpec Products Inc. Minibeadbeater-16 for 1 min and incubated at 95C for 10 min. The remaining steps were preformed as per manufacturer protocol. DNA was eluted with 100 uL buffer EB (Qiagen) and stored at _20C. For each sample, we amplified the 16s rRNA gene using the reverse primer 5_-GCCTCCCTCGCGCCATCAGNNNNNNNN CTGCTGCCTYCCGTA-3_ and the forward primer 5_-GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAG AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3_. The underlined sequences are the 454 Life Sciences primer B (forward) and A (reverse). The italicized sequence is the broad range bacterial primer BSR357 (reverse) and BSF8 (forward). Each reverse primer contained a unique 8-nt error-correcting Hamming barcode (designated by NNNNNNNN) used to tag each PCR product. Duplicate 25uL reactions were carried out with AccuPrime Taq DNA Polymerase High Fidelity (Invitrogen) under the following reaction conditions: 2.5 uL 10_ Buffer 2, 0.4 uL Taq, 11.1 uL PCR-grade H2O, 0.5 uL forward primer and 0.5 uL reverse primer (20 pmol/uL each) and 10 uL template DNA. PCR reactions were assembled in a PCR bay in which all surfaces and pipettes had been decontaminated with DNA AWAY (Molecular BioProducts). Reactions were run on a Applied Biosystems Veriti thermocycler with the following cycling conditions: initial denaturing at 95C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 95C for 30 seconds, annealing at 56C for 30 seconds, and extension at 72 C for 90 seconds, with a final extension of 8 min at 72C. Replicate amplicons were pooled and visualized on 0.8% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide. Amplicons were bead purified using Agencourt AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter) as per manufacturer instructions. Purified amplicons were quantified using Quant-iT PicoGreen kit (Invitrogen) and pooled in equimolar ratios.
